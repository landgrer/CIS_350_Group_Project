### 1. Abstract
Classes are hard for many students. Many students may struggle with coursework, and this can affect their grade and possibly their future. This may require students to acquire extra help, and this help may come through fellow classmates, teachers, or tutors. Essentially, there is a need for tutors, and these tutors may be hard to find, and it may be even harder to find one that is experienced in exactly what the student is looking for. Our idea for our Tutor Finder application is to connect students with someone who can help them with their curriculum needs. The purpose is to give students a way to find tutors in their area that meet their requirements for help. The students and tutors will be able to communicate and determine meeting times that will be able to accommodate both the tutor's schedule and the student's schedule.

### 2. Introduction
With the number of college undergraduate students increasing yearly, the demand for education increases with it. Many students study every year especially new, incoming freshmen, and it can be hard for these new students to find help. The benefits of mobile devices can be used to help connect students with another, and this can be used to support them in their struggles with their classes. Our app, TutorFinder, has one goal, and it is to connect students with others nearby to find help with classes and subjects they are currently struggling with. The app is on mobile devices as nearly everybody has a cellphone on their person at most times of the day, and they are more readily available than computers accessing a website. TutorFinder can be used to filter out help through different subjects, different times, and different locations.

### 3. Architectural Design
___
Our TutorFinder app is based off the client-server architecture. Our users must install the app onto an Android Platform as it is built upon an Android User Interface. The user will receive information from our Firebase Database about other users. This information includes whether or not they are a tutor or a student. The database stores the users' primary subject, available times, their ratings based on reviews from other users, and the users' name.
