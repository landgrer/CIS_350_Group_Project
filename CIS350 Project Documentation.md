### 1. Abstract
Classes are hard for many students. Many students may struggle with coursework, and this can affect their grade and possibly their future. This may require students to acquire extra help, and this help may come through fellow classmates, teachers, or tutors. Essentially, there is a need for tutors, and these tutors may be hard to find, and it may be even harder to find one that is experienced in exactly what the student is looking for. Our idea for our Tutor Finder application is to connect students with someone who can help them with their curriculum needs. The purpose is to give students a way to find tutors in their area that meet their requirements for help. The students and tutors will be able to communicate and determine meeting times that will be able to accommodate both the tutor's schedule and the student's schedule.
